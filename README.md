# MS-ON-ukb-code This repository contains a collection of codes used to generate MS-GRS 

HLA-GRS was created using direct_hla_interaction_score.ipynb and 2 SNPs scored in python (will merge these two files as a an .sh file, and will add an R file merging the results). Interaction HLA GRS is based on a 10-allele model reported by Moutsianas et al (2015) reported on page 15, section 3.0

non-HLA GRS was created using file ***name***

non-HLA and HLA-GRS were merged using ***NAME*** 

phenotypic analysis was done in stata using ***NAME*** 

Figures and subsequent ROC and survival analysis were performed in python ***NAME***
